<h1>RNA-unchained: Chaining sequence/structure seeds for computing RNA similarity</h1>

RNA-unchainedfind seeds of pattern matching between an RNA query and other RNA) to 
boost the alignment of these RNA.  RNAunchained explicitly chains and aligns based
on both RNA sequence and structure. It compute pairwise analyse between a query
and the computed RNA index database.

<h2> Installation Instructions </h2> 

Run RNA-unchained with python v2.7 or higher but not python v3.0 or higher.  No other
compilation is necessary, except installing and configuring other packages.

<ul>
<li> ViennaRNA v2.1.1 or higher           
</li><li> LocARNA v1.7.6 
</li>
</ul>

To install RNA-unchained in a UNIX environment, please follow these simple instructions:
<ol>
  <li>Install the ViennaRNA package (at least version 2.1.1)
  (<a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/">Download
  Vienna RNA package</a>).</li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Install Locarna 1.7.6 (<a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/LocARNA/Releases/">Download Locarna</a>)
  <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Download <a href="RNA-unchained.tar.gz">RNA-unchained.tar.gz</a>.  Extract
    the contents into a directory by running the command
    <p>
      tar xvzf RNAunchained.tar.gz
    </p>
  
    Run RNA-unchained on a fasta file with the command
    <p>
    RNA-unchained.py [options]
    </p>
    To see a list of options for RNAunchained.py, run it with the --help or -h option. Please refer to the included README for further details on using RNAunchained and a description of output files.
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
   In order to test that RNAunchained and all packages were installed correctly, we have provided a fasta file 'test.fa' in the archive. As an example run RNAunchained on test.fa with the following command to obtain all vs all alignments with the two RNA-unchained options (seed and anchor optimizations):
    <p>
    python RNA-unchained.py -m -db TEST test.fa

    </p>
    <p>
    python RNA-unchained.py -c -rfb -epc -db TEST test.fa
    </p>
    <p>
    python RNA-unchained.py -a -rfb -epc -db TEST test.fa
    </p>
    RNAunchained will align using Locarna with constraints. Finally, RNAunchained will output 'chaining_alignment_options.txt' and 'chaining_score_options.txt' that contains alignments and score of alignments and 'name_options_constraints.txt' that contains tree chaining constraints.
